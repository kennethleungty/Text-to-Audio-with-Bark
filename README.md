# Exploring Text-to-Audio with Bark (WIP)

Link to TowardsDataScience article: *Coming Soon*

## Context
- Amidst the transformative surge of generative AI, text-to-audio models are emerging as one of the most promising frontiers. 
- These advances are not just about converting text to speech, but also about crafting audio experiences that are indistinguishable from human-produced content.
- From audiobooks narrated in any voice imaginable to dynamic music compositions prompted by mere sentences, the potential applications are vast and captivating.
- In this article, we delve into the capabilities and technical intricacies of Bark, an open-source text-prompted audio generation model in Python.

## Introducing Bark
Bark is a transformer-based text-to-audio model capable of generating realistic multilingual speech, music, and sound effects. It is created by Suno, a research-driven company that develops cutting-edge audio AI.
As Bark was developed for research purposes, its pre-trained model checkpoints have been made open-source and available for commercial use, which is a valuable contribution to the generative AI community.
